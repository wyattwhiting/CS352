# CS325 - Intro to Usability Engineering
## Oregon State University, Winter 2021

In this repo, you can find all the documents submitted by my team, Fornacis, for Intro to Usability Engineering at Oregon State University. While I obviously did not write all or even a majority of the text found within, I contributed to each one. These contributions are documented at the end of each document, if you are at all curious. My role within the group was Team Leader, and my responsilibites included scheduling and leading weekly meetings, as well as dividing labor evenly between all members. 

### Final Grade
I received an A in this course.
