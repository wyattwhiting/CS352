-"I go ahead and submit the information"

REFLECTION SECTION
What are your general thoughts about the workflow of these tasks?

-I think for the most part, they're pretty intuitive
-buttons are intuitive, could help me with most interestst when using it

What difficulties did you encounter when trying to accomplish these tasks?

-finding the most recent bird sighting in my area
-the purple finch not being the top search result despite being exact word match for task description
	-might have missed it had i not paid attention
	
For any difficulties you faced, what was your initial instinct?

-for the finding nearest in my area, it would have been the pin on the map and then I would have instinctively used the filter of gear button to filter by recency, something of that nature
-maybe if map had time signature on the pin. like '4:50 pm' with the date or something

How difficult was searching for the “purple finch?”

-on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 and a half

How difficult was creating a new account?

-0 out of 10

How difficult was locating recent sightings in your area?

-uh, like 7 out of 10

How difficult was locating your own profile?

-0 out of 10

What information were you expecting to find in the Wiki page that wasn’t there?

-*scans screen for several moments* maybe like, I don't know, more information or a more visual representation of these things. Maybe like a picture of the US and a shaded region where they're found or referernce to size with common household object

What were your broad thoughts on the app’s navigation?

-I think it has a very modern feel to it in the sense that a lot of application these days have a toolbar at the bottom with 4 or 5 different sections
-logical
-makes sense, looks sleek
	-except for recent sightings
	
Did you find any feature particularly easy to understand?

-search function
-confused to see 'diet' as search criteria. Would have expected name and region
	-would have been easier to user 'locale' if it was drop down menu
-diet sticks out as search criteria
	-"maybe unless you're looking up predatory birds"
	
If you could design this app, what are 2 things you would change immediately?

-would change recent sightings to be something on the home page
-refers back to encyclopedia listing -- add more visuals for information rather than text
	-"maps and pictures make happy"
	
Do you have any final thoughts or comments?

-"uh, nope. it's all good"
